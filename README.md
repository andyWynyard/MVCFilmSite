# SpringMVC CRUD for a film database

The goal of this project is to implement CRUD functionality to a video rental store database.

The current functionality includes the ability to create, edit and delete actors from the database. This has been proven through both the terminal interface and the application itself.

Added ability to add and delete films from database. Actors are also able to be added to a film by filmID.

TODO: Ability to edit films, add Actor to film via the title.


I feel like this project has somewhat gotten away from me. I have added a great many things that I feel is too far past the MVP. Next time I might use an application such as Trello to maintain both time and efficiency.
